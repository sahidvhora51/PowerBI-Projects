# 📊 Data Analytics & Power BI Portfolio

Welcome to my analytics portfolio!  
This repository serves as a central directory for all the **Power BI projects** I have created, each stored in its own dedicated repository.  
The projects included demonstrate my ability to work end-to-end across the complete data analytics lifecycle:  
**data collection → cleaning → modeling → transformation → visualization → insight generation.**

Although only the **Power BI dashboard files (PBIX)** are uploaded in each project repository, the backend work includes extensive **data engineering, feature creation, and analytics logic** using industry-standard tools.

## 🚀 What I Do in Each Project
Every project in this portfolio includes the following steps (performed by me before creating the dashboard):

### 🔧 **1. Data Preparation in Python**
- Cleaning raw datasets (missing values, outliers, formatting issues)  
- Feature engineering  
- Aggregation and normalization  
- Exporting clean datasets for modeling  

### 🗄️ **2. Star Schema Design in SQL**
- Creating fact and dimension tables  
- Ensuring clean relationships  
- Running SQL transformations and calculations  
- Designing scalable data models for analytics  

### ⚙️ **3. Power Query Transformations**
- Type corrections  
- Merging & joining multiple datasets  
- Data shaping for Power BI model  
- Date table creation & normalization  

### 📐 **4. DAX Calculations**
- Building KPIs and metrics  
- Time intelligence (YTD, YOY, moving averages, forecasting)  
- Segmentation logic  
- Custom business rules  
- Calculated columns & measures  

⚠️ *These backend files (Python, SQL, Power Query M scripts, and DAX files) are not uploaded publicly. Only the **PBIX dashboards** and documentation are included.*
